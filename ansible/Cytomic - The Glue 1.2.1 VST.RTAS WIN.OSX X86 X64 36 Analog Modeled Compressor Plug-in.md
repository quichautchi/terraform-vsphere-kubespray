One of the main features of Cytomic - The Glue 1.2.1 is the ultra-fast attack time of up to 0.01mS, which allows you to catch transients and add punch and clarity to your mix. Another feature is the Range knob, which backs off the compression to give incredibly natural sounding attacks and limits the maximum amount of compression applied. This way, you can avoid over-compressing your signal and preserve its dynamics and musicality.
 
Cytomic - The Glue 1.2.1 also supports external sidechain input and an adjustable sidechain highpass filter, which gives you more control over the compression triggering and frequency response. You can use these features to create ducking effects, de-essing, or selective compression of certain frequency ranges.
 
Cytomic - The Glue 1.2.1 is compatible with VST and RTAS formats, and it works on both Windows and Mac OS X platforms. It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, and it has a low CPU usage and latency. You can download a free trial version from the official website[^1^], or buy the full version for $99 USD.
 
Cytomic - The Glue 1.2.1 is a plug-in that can enhance your mixes with its smooth and transparent compression, its analog warmth and character, and its flexible features. Whether you are working on rock, pop, hip hop, electronic, or any other genre of music, you can benefit from using this plug-in on your master buss or individual tracks.

You can switch between the modes to find the one that suits your material best.
 
Another advantage of Cytomic - The Glue 1.2.1 is that it has a built-in oversampling feature that can improve the sound quality and reduce aliasing artifacts. You can choose from four different oversampling rates: x1, x2, x4, and x8. The higher the oversampling rate, the more CPU power and latency it will consume, but the better the sound quality will be. You can also enable or disable the oversampling feature depending on your needs.
